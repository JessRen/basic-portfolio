      <p>I am engaged in this Coding Bootcamp because I want to employ both CSS and Javascript effectively, and I want framework deployments to be optional and when truly advisable. The notion that using Bootstrap classes in layout creates an HTML document vividly similar to table layouts of old: this registers very true to me. Also, successes within CSS3 to add functionalities like Animation (with the animable @keyframes) have aided the directive of separate presentation files as well as the owner-stake of CSS in those presentation files, and afforded some independence from interactively-complicated code which in many effective categories becomes higher maintenance after launch, given handling of deprecations plus the kitchen-sink approach. Mobile Responsiveness likewise is a core CSS terrain, and Flex-box a major component for modern-day block arrangements that were floated in past.</p> 

      <p>So my objective in this Unit is to determine when the total load of Bootstrap is best warranted, and to draw insights from the vast styles promoted within it. Even in linking related CDN(s) rather than requiring their local file retrieval, the templated styles promote some regressive coding behaviorisms in what seems to avoid pre-launch browser testing, while engaging a ton of Javascript for any-case-scenarios,  often running antithetical to custom solutions. In this vein, knowing how and when to incorporate Bootstrap best, and not just "when it's mobile-responsive" or "when I don't worry about scaling it" or "when its loadtimes are not mobile-sensitive" is just the start of knowing what Responsive advantages to retain in creating unique layout features with excellent, browser-adept CSS. It's also a nod to extricating through past Bootstrap when required.</p>
